Throughout this workshop students will gain an intuitive understanding of the architectures and engines that make up deep learning models, apply a variety of deep learning algorithms (i.e. MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, collaborative filtering), understand when and how to tune the various hyperparameters, and be able to interpret model results. Students will have the opportunity to apply practical applications covering a variety of tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, product recommendation and more. By the end of this module, students should have a firm grasp of deep learning and be able to implement a systematic approach for producing high quality modeling results. Who should read this TBD This module makes a few assumptions of your established knowledge regarding your programming skills. Below are some important assumptions made and resources to read through if you feel inadequately prepared: Complete after rest of material is finalized. Assumptions Resource Resource You should be familiar with… You should be familiar with… You should be familiar with… You should be familiar with… What you need for this book TBD Conventions used in this book The following typographical conventions are used in this book: strong italic: indicates new terms, bold: indicates package &amp; file names, inline code: monospaced highlighted text indicates functions or other commands that could be typed literally by the user, code chunk: indicates commands or other text that could be typed literally by the user 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 We will also refer to both R and Python throughout. When discussing one or the other we will typically label with the appropriate icons: Python: R: In addition to the general text used throughout, you will notice the following code chunks: Signifies a tip or suggestion Signifies a general note Signifies a warning or caution Feedback Reader comments are greatly appreciated.
