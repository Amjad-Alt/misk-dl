## Overview

This module introduces the essential concepts of building deep learning models with TensorFlow and Keras. Throughout this module students will gain an intuitive understanding of the architectures and engines that make up deep learning models, apply a variety of deep learning algorithms (i.e. MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, collaborative filtering), understand when and how to tune the various hyperparameters, and be able to interpret model results. Students will have the opportunity to apply practical applications covering a variety of tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, product recommendation and more. By the end of this module, students should have a firm grasp of deep learning and be able to implement a systematic approach for producing high quality modeling results.
